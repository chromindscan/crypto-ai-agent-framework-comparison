TLDR;,"GAME empowers AI agents to operate autonomously, processing inputs and generating responses while learning from past interactions. It enhances decision-making by leveraging long-term memory, including experiences, reflections, and dynamic personality traits. By continuously evaluating the outcomes of actions and conversations, GAME enables agents to refine their knowledge and improve their planning and performance over time.
","Eliza is a powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. Built with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.

","ZerePy is an open-source Python framework that enables deployment of AI agents on X (formerly Twitter) using OpenAI or Anthropic LLMs, offering features like CLI management, social media integration, and modular connections.","Rig is a Rust library that simplifies building LLM-powered applications by providing common abstractions over LLM providers and vector stores.
It offers full support for LLM completion and embedding workflows while minimizing boilerplate code, making integration seamless and efficient.","The Open-Source AgentOS: Build production-ready multi-agent systems in minutes, not months. A framework for seamless agent orchestration, conversation management, and integration, powered by AG2.","CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating teams of AI agents that work together like a company structure, where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals to accomplish complex tasks collaboratively.","LangChain is a comprehensive framework for building LLM-powered applications with robust development tools, monitoring capabilities, and deployment options through LangGraph and LangSmith platforms. ","DSPy is a Python framework focused on programming (rather than prompting) language models through modular, composable code structures. It enables automated optimization of prompts and weights for building AI systems ranging from simple classifiers to complex RAG pipelines and agent loops.","An open-source framework designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents in complex conversations, available in both Python and TypeScript. It intelligently routes queries to appropriate specialized agents while maintaining conversation context across interactions. The framework includes pre-built components and supports custom integrations.","GOAT (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit) is an open-source framework that enables AI agents to interact with multiple blockchain networks including EVM chains, Solana, and Chromia, supporting various wallet types and smart contract interactions.
The framework provides a unified interface that works with popular agent development platforms like Langchain and Vercel's AI SDK, while offering customizable plugins for different blockchain functionalities and protocols.","Model Flexibility: AgentKit's model-agnostic design supports multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, and Llama, giving developers the freedom to choose the AI model that best suits their needs.
Built-in onchain functionality: Built on top of the Coinbase Developer Platform SDK, AgentKit provides native access to comprehensive blockchain functionality, ensuring reliable and secure onchain operations.
LangChain Compatibility: Full support for LangChain and its extensive community toolkits enables developers to leverage existing tools and frameworks in their projects"
